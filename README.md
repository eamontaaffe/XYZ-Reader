> Your job will be to take the feedback in the UI Review node, and implement changes that will improve the UI and make it conform to Material Design.


### UI Review Node

> Lyla says:
> “This app is starting to shape up but it feels a bit off in quite a few places. I can't put finger on it but it feels odd.”

> Jay says:
> “Is the text supposed to be so wonky and unreadable? It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision."

> Kagure says:
> “The color scheme is really sad and I shouldn't feel sad.”
